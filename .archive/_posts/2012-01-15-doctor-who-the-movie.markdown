io9 reports today that [there are rumors that _Harry Potter_ director David Yates could direct a movie adaptation of _Doctor Who_](http://io9.com/5859431/a-new-doctor-who-movie-from-the-director-of-the-harry-potter-films). What&#8253;

I believe a film such as this, if done right, could bring to the television show an audience that it would never get on it's own. I, like io9's Charlie Anders, want _Doctor Who_ to be for everyone, not just it's life-long fans.

Nothing has been confirmed yet, but the movie would not be in any way connected to the television series we all know and love.

> It needs quite a radical transformation to take it into the bigger arena. ... The notion of the time-travelling Time Lord is such a strong one, because you can express story and drama in any dimension or time... Russell T. Davies and then Steven Moffat have done their own transformations, which were fantastic, but we have to put that aside and start from scratch.

As far as I know (I have only seen from Christopher Eccleston to present day episodes), there are two areas that have not been covered by the show already: pre-William Hartnell and [The Last Great Time War](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Great_Time_War).

I think that showing what the Doctor was like before he was the Doctor would be great. Even showing what he was like before finding (or, rather, stealing) his TARDIS. Seeing what happened to lead up to the events of the very first episode of the television show would be great, plus it won't alienate the current fan base.

The Last Great Time War has, as far as I know, only been in some graphic novels and books. There have been mentions of from the current series, but we haven't had much of actual footage. Seeing what the Doctor was like from the time of the 1986 movie to the Ninth Doctor would be interesting to see. Plus, lots of action.

I trust David Yates with the series. I love what he did with _Harry Potter_, and he was true to the books. I think he could make a great film while being true to the essence of the show and its' fans.

Also, how awesome would it be to have an actor like Nathan Fillion as the Doctor?
