At the end of every great day at Epcot in Walt Disney World is the award-winning fireworks, laser, and fountain show [_IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IllumiNations:_Reflections_of_Earth). It started in 1999 to celebrate the new millenuium but proved so popular that it continues to this day. The [soundtrack](http://www.amazon.com/Walt-Disney-World-Millennium-Celebration/dp/B00001WRO3/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1329664618&sr=8-1) is wonderful, and it great for ambient music.
