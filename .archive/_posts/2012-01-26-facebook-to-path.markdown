With the explosion in the number of smartphones in high schooler's hands, the number of teenager users that are using mobile-only apps like [Instagram](http://instagr.am/) and [Oink](http://oink.com) are skyrocketing. For that reason, I expect a mass exodus of teens from Facebook to [Path](http://path.com).

There are already early adopters from my school, and they are trying to spread the network as fast and to as many people as possible. And, as far as I can tell, it's working. Since I looked last week, thirty people from my school have joined Path. That's not a signifigant number in the overall scheme of things, but that means that there is a market for networks like these with teens.

Google+ could have been a contender with the teen market. But with Google's repeated refusal to allow 13- to 18-year-olds into the beginning of the beta, they essentially killed their chances with teens.

I could also see some trouble with Path. The limit to 150 friends and lack of a desktop version will definitely shy people away. Yet I look forward to the time where I don't even need to visit the increasingly terrible Facebook to catch up with friends.
