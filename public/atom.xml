    <id>http://ethan.heroku.com2012/01/down-with-sopa</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I made this site redirect to <a href="http://sopastrike.com/strike">SOPA Strike</a> in opposition of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (Protect IP Act). I am vehemently opposed to such draconian, broad bills such as these.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t know, SOPA and PIPA aim to shut down sites that are infringing upon American intellectual property such as music, movies, photos, and books.</p>

<p>That idea is sound, but the methods and language that the bills use are morally and ethically wrong. Sites that are found to be infringed by industry organizations (like the RIAA and MPAA) can be shut down without due process or chance for an appeal. The DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) handles this by providing &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; to social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. But under SOPA or PIPA, these sites would be gone from the Internet.</p>

<p>These bills allow the United States to assert control over all domestically registered domains (.com, .net, .org, et cetera). Any international site that infringes upon U.S. intellectual property can be shut down entirely, even though the site is out of U.S. jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Both bills are overly wide, not only targeting sites that have infringing content, but other legitimate businesses. Google and other search engines have to meticulously comb their own sites and remove anything that would be remotely close to infringing upon intellectual property. Twitter and Facebook would have to censor their own users so that they do not get in trouble with the government.</p>

<p>Companies that are in support of SOPA/PIPA are, well, assholes. The RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) and the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), two historically draconian companies, have loads of money to lobby for these bills. Comcast and other Internet providers are for the bills as well (ironically, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/11/2700420/comcast-confused-about-dns-rerouting-dnssec-sopa/in/2405432">Comcast just upgraded their network</a> to use technology that would make it impossible for them to implement SOPA/PIPA).</p>

<p>While the Senate and House are widely in support of these bills, mainly because of lobbyists and their money, the general population is largely against them. At my school in particular, my history teacher took a large amount of class time to talk about how this threatens the Internet as we know it. Because of the Wikipedia blackout, the school is a-buzz with anti-SOPA conversation, and posters have appeared urging students to call our representatives and senators (unfortunately, all of our representatives are co-sponsors here in Connecticut, so there isn&#8217;t much chance of having them change their minds).</p>

<p>All in all, SOPA and PIPA threaten American free speech and the freedom of the Internet as we know it. It would allow the government and corporate interest groups to
censor the Internet as they please, putting us on a similar level as China and Iran. If you can, express your opposition on social networking sites or even call your representatives. Help stop this bill from becoming a horrible, draconian law.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/16/2641391/the-stop-online-piracy-act-the-sopa-story-so-far">The Verge has an excellent collection of posts about SOPA and PIPA</a>. Also, <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/01/17/pipasopa-and-why-you-should-care/">Mozilla has a great post in layman&#8217;s terms on why SOPA is bad for the Internet</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After about six months, countless designs, and head-desking, I&#8217;ve finally created a (functioning) design that I actually like. It&#8217;s running on a modifed version of <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> that allows me to <a href="http://kottke.org/05/10/tumblelogs">tumblelog</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve decided against importing my old Tumblr posts. Mainly because Tumblr&#8217;s API is dumb (it uses XML with inconsistent tags!), but also because I want to start fresh. There are a lot of really terrible, non-informative posts there.</p>

<p>The code for this site and the theme are <a href="http://github.com/eturk/ethan">on Github</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/eturk/ethan/tree/master/.themes/ethan">theme</a> is under the MIT License, so you&#8217;re free to do whatever you wish with it.</p>

<p>I may or may not add comments to this site. In the meantime, feel free to talk to me on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/ethnt">@ethnt</a>.</p>

    <updated>2012-01-15T11:59:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://ethan.heroku.com2012/01/doctor-who-the-movie</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>io9 reports today that <a href="http://io9.com/5859431/a-new-doctor-who-movie-from-the-director-of-the-harry-potter-films">there are rumors that <em>Harry Potter</em> director David Yates could direct a movie adaptation of <em>Doctor Who</em></a>. What&#8253;</p>

<p>I believe a film such as this, if done right, could bring to the television show an audience that it would never get on it&#8217;s own. I, like io9&#8217;s Charlie Anders, want <em>Doctor Who</em> to be for everyone, not just it&#8217;s life-long fans.</p>

<p>Nothing has been confirmed yet, but the movie would not be in any way connected to the television series we all know and love.</p>

<blockquote><p>It needs quite a radical transformation to take it into the bigger arena. &#8230; The notion of the time-travelling Time Lord is such a strong one, because you can express story and drama in any dimension or time&#8230; Russell T. Davies and then Steven Moffat have done their own transformations, which were fantastic, but we have to put that aside and start from scratch.</p></blockquote>

<p>As far as I know (I have only seen from Christopher Eccleston to present day episodes), there are two areas that have not been covered by the show already: pre-William Hartnell and <a href="http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Last_Great_Time_War">The Last Great Time War</a>.</p>

<p>I think that showing what the Doctor was like before he was the Doctor would be great. Even showing what he was like before finding (or, rather, stealing) his TARDIS. Seeing what happened to lead up to the events of the very first episode of the television show would be great, plus it won&#8217;t alienate the current fan base.</p>

<p>The Last Great Time War has, as far as I know, only been in some graphic novels and books. There have been mentions of from the current series, but we haven&#8217;t had much of actual footage. Seeing what the Doctor was like from the time of the 1986 movie to the Ninth Doctor would be interesting to see. Plus, lots of action.</p>

<p>I trust David Yates with the series. I love what he did with <em>Harry Potter</em>, and he was true to the books. I think he could make a great film while being true to the essence of the show and its&#8217; fans.</p>

<p>Also, how awesome would it be to have an actor like Nathan Fillion as the Doctor?</p>
