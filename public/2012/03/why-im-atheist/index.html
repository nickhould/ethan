	<p>About four years ago (or in seventh grade), I read <em>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</em> by Douglas Adams.</p>

<blockquote><p>In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.</p>

<p>Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure.</p>

<p>The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel.</p>

<p>However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle VI and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought.</p></blockquote>

<p>Douglas Adams was a staunch atheist who called himself a radical atheist, to &#8220;signal that I really mean it, have thought about it a great deal, and that it&#8217;s an opinion I hold seriously&#8221;.</p>

<p>I, however, am not a radical atheist. In fact, I&#8217;m what is referred to as an &#8220;agnostic atheist&#8221;. Essentially, this means that I do not believe there is a God (or Gods, plural) because of lack of scientific evidence. As Christopher Hitchens most eloquently saysâ€”</p>

<blockquote><p>What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Therein lies what is referred to as &#8220;Hitchen&#8217;s Razor&#8221;. Because all religions assert that there is a God without any empirical evidence to back up their claims, it is just as easy for me to dismiss their claims.</p>

<p>Another convicing deductive argument is &#8220;Russell&#8217;s teapot&#8221;. If I were to say that there was teapot orbiting the sun between the Moon and Mars, it would be nonsensical for me to expect others to not doubt me on the grounds that they could not prove me wrong. The same applies to religion.</p>

<p>Then there is the argument of absurdity. The fact that I am expected to believe that what is said in a two-thousand-year-old text written in the one of the most uneducated parts of the world is preposterous. And then there is the content of this text!</p>

<p>It is often said that atheists have read and understood the Bible, for example, better than most Christians. The contradictions, holes, and utter abominations in the Bible shock me.</p>

<p>I suppose I don&#8217;t hate religion for what it believes but what havoc is causes on the world. [CONTINUE]</p>

<p>A lot of theists that I know despise the organized religion (i.e., the Catholic Church and the Pope).</p>
