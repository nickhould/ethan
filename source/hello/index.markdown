Hello! My name is Ethan Turkeltaub, and I'm a sixteen-year-old student and web developer. I quite enjoy creating websites, both on the front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and on the back-end with Ruby and MongoDB.

I've been creating websites semi-professionally for about seven years. In that time, I've become quite good at Ruby, a dynamically-typed and completely object-oriented programming language. [Rails](http://github.com/rails/rails) is cool and all, but [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com) is much more suited to projects that I do.

I'm currently learning Java for <abbr title="Advanced Placement">AP</abbr> Computer Science, and I hope to go to college for a mix of computer science and graphic design (i.e., a Bachelor of the Science in Computer Science and a minor in Graphic Design).

Besides the web, I like music, swimming, and running. I attempt to write comprehensibly here about a variety of subjects, ranging from atheism to Walt Disney World (of which I have a strong opinion on both!).

To talk to me about projects, [email me](mailto:ethan.turkeltaub@gmail.com), [tweet at me](http://twitter.com/ethnt), or [message me on GitHub](http://github.com/eturk).
