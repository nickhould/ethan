United Nations special rapporteur on torture Juan Mendez has ruled that the conditions that the U.S. government are holding Wikileaks whistleblower Bradley Manning are "cruel and inhuman". The Pentagon even refused to allow Mendez to see Manning in private, which is a violation of human rights procedures. Don't forget that the court martial has not even ruled on the issue yet.
