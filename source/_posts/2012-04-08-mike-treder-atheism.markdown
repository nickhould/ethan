    I'm sorry if my atheism offends you. But guess whatâ€”religious wars, Jihads, Crusades, Inquisitions, censoring of free speech, brainwashing of children, murdering of albinos, forcing girls into underage marriages, male and female genital mutilation, stoning, pederasty, homophobia, and rejection of science and reason offends me.
