After about six months, countless designs, and head-desking, I've finally created a (functioning) design that I actually like. It's running on a modifed version of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) that allows me to [tumblelog](http://kottke.org/05/10/tumblelogs).

I've decided against importing my old Tumblr posts. Mainly because Tumblr's API is dumb (it uses XML with inconsistent tags!), but also because I want to start fresh. There are a lot of really terrible, non-informative posts there.

The code for this site and the theme are [on Github](http://github.com/eturk/ethan). The [theme](https://github.com/eturk/ethan/tree/master/.themes/ethan) is under the MIT License, so you're free to do whatever you wish with it.

I may or may not add comments to this site. In the meantime, feel free to talk to me on Twitter as [@ethnt](http://twitter.com/ethnt).
