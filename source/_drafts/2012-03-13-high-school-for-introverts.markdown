  title: High School for Introverts

It is said that high school is all about the social experience. However, for introverts like me this poses a problem. We don't like social experiences—we prefer alone time and careful observation rather than being a social butterfly all of the time.

As a happy junior, I think I qualify as being able to help other struggling introverts with high school. I'm not an expert—far from it—I've just been able to overcome my shyness and become happy. Hopefully I can help you too.

### Use social networks.

Everyone's stronger behind a keyboard. If there's someone you've even casually talked to once or twice in class, chat them up on Facebook or Twitter. It's often easier than face-to-face interaction, and it's a good way to start a friendship. If someone has similar interests to you, talk to them about that.


### Don't dwell on the past.

It's really easy to think about bad past experiences and think "I can never do this". In fact, it's better that you've had some failures rather than just successes so you now know what to avoid. Let these experiences shape you, but not let them bring you down. It's the past—you can't change it, but you can let it shape you. Just live with no regrets.


### Have one or two close friends.

Having at least one close friend that you can talk to about anything—bonus points if they're extraverted—is extremely beneficial. When you can talk to someone about your problems or someone that can guide you through the world of extraversion it can make everything a whole lot easier.


### Find your niche (clubs or sports).

If you like a certain sport, like swimming or basketball, join up for that sport at your school. It will give you a group of friends that you have similar interests in, and often the camaraderie of a team can make any shy person come out of their shell.

Even if you don't like sports, clubs are always welcoming. If you like the environment, join your Green Team. If you enjoy making art, join an Art Club.

Having people around with similar interests is great for morale. You actually get a sense of belonging to a group, and you're not alone in the world anymore.


### You don't have to attend every school event to be sociable.

If your school is like my school, then events planned by faculty or is sponsored by the school often suck. Being with drunk, sweaty people at dances isn't exactly fun. Sports events can be okay, but are often very "meh".

No one says you have to go to and enjoy every single school-sponsored event to be considered "sociable". Go to the events that interest you with some friends and that will make anyone happy.


### Just be nice.

If you're sulking and cold a lot, it's about time you brighten up. Just being nice to people leaves an impression, and leaving a good impression is something that will make getting along and being sociable a whole lot easier.
