Walt Disney World is large. Big even. I mean, you may think it's a long way down to the market, but that's peanuts to the World.

The World is 30,080 acres total. That's about 47 square miles, or 121.7 square kilometers. If you can't picture that, that's about twice the size of Manhattan. So yes, it's big.

And in that land you can find four theme parks, two water parks, twenty-three themed hotels (plus eight more non-Disney hotels), a campground, two health spas, five golf courses, and one-hundred and thirty-nine restaurants.

It is impossible to see all of this in one visit. You need to accept this. But, in order to know what you're doing and how to do it as efficiently as possible, you need a guide. And that's where I come in.

In the coming weeks (or months, I haven't written everything yet), I will bring you through everything you need to know to have an enjoyable, cost-efficient vacation, with some tips along the way.

### But first, a bit of history.

The year was 1959. Disneyland has been open for four years, and it has been a huge hit. However, some problems were arising. Most of all was Disneyland's lack of space. It was, after all, built in the middle of the city. Local businesses were leeching on Disney's successes by building up and crowding around the park entrance.

This is not what Walt had imagined. He wanted complete control of the guest's experience, from arrival to departure.

Segue to 1963. Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) was looking all along the East Coast for a suitable location for the new development, dubbed "The Florida Project". Finally, in 1965, they found the perfect area—a swamp in central Florida, a few miles southwest of Orlando. Using several shell corporations to avoid speculation, WDI purchased 27,443 acres of land.

Over the next eight years, Disney constructed the Disney's Magic Kingdom, Disney's Contemporary Resort, Disney's Polynesian Resort, and Disney's Fort Wilderness Campground. The World opened to the public on October 1st, 1971.

Business boomed. Disney was becoming the cultural behemoth it is today. In 1982, Walt was post-humously able to achieve his dream of a "city of tomorrow" with the opening of The Epcot Center (now just Epcot) as a permanent World's Fair-like exposition. In 1989, Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney's Hollywood Studios) opened as a tribute to the movie business and as a response to nearby Universal Studio's success. Most recently, in 1998, Disney's Animal Kingdom opened to the public.

### An overview.

**Magic Kingdom** is exactly what most people think of when they think about Walt Disney World. Opened in 1972, it is the smallest of the major theme parks. Yet, it crams so much into such a (relatively) small space. The park features six "lands" (different sections of the park that have a specific theme); Main Street U.S.A., Adventureland, Fantasyland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, and Tomorrowland. A seventh land, Storybook Circus, is due to open in late 2012 as part of a Fantasyland expansion. Overall, the Magic Kingdom features rides for the younger generation of kids, with many character meet-n-greets. And, of course, there's always Cinderella Castle. Even though Magic Kingdom is a small part of Disney World, it remains the heart.

**Epcot**, originally The EPCOT Center, opened in 1982. Walt Disney's dream was to create a Utopian community of twenty-thousand, and would be a model for urban planning and development. However, Disney couldn't realize his dream until he built Magic Kingdom and built up funds. Unfortunately, Walt died before his dream was realized. Today, Epcot is something completely different. Acting as sort of a permanent World's Fair, there are two major areas; Future World, and World Showcase. Future World is dedicated to technology and human advancement, and is situated right after the main entrance. World Showcase features eleven pavilions devoted to different countries architecture, entertainment, food, and customs. The countries featured are; Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, The American Adventure, Japan, Morocco, France, United Kingdom, and Canada.

**Disney's Hollywood Studios**, originally named Disney-MGM Studios, opened in 1989. It is all about the show and movie business (it was built as a response to the growing popularity of nearby Universal Studios), and stylized like the 30's and 40's. The Studios is separated into two areas. The first encompassing the past, present, and future of show business, with rides to match. The second is an idle motion picture and television production facility. Though about the size of Magic Kingdom, this is not a full-day park.

**Disney's Animal Kingdom** is another one of Walt's dreams realized. He longed for a zoo that wasn't really zoo, a place where you could see animals in their natural habitat. And, when walking into the Animal Kingdom, you see to what extent that was taken. The park combines zoological attractions with rides, shows, and musicals. It's about five times the size of the Magic Kingdom—but half of that is for free-roaming African animals. Arranged somewhat like Magic Kingdom, the Animal Kingdom features five lands; Discovery Island, Asia, Africa, Dino-Land U.S.A., and Camp Minnie-Mickey. Opened in 1998, it has (in my opinion) the best theme execution of any park. You can tell the Disney team went to extreme lengths to make each area as accurate to it's namesake as possible.

**Typhoon Lagoon** and **Blizzard Beach** are the World's two water parks. Equal in size, Typhoon Lagoon (opened in 1989), features a 6-foot wave pool, while Blizzard Beach (opened in 1995), features a 100-foot near-vertical water slide. Both are well featured and has a theme of tropical resort and ski resort, respectively.

**Downtown Disney** is a huge shopping, dining, and entertainment complex. It consists of Downtown Disney Marketplace to the east and Downtown Disney West Side to the west. There are almost forty shops here, with countless restaurants for every taste. For entertainment, there is Cirque du Soliel: La Nouba, a 24-screen theatre, and DisneyQuest. For more shopping, there is **Boardwalk**. It is geared more toward young adults and has many bars and clubs.
