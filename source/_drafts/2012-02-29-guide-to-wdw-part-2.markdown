In order to make the most of your Walt Disney World vacation, you’ll need to plan. Making it up as you go can work for parks, but for an entire vacation, you need to make plans ahead of time. And those plans begin with knowing when you’re going to go.


### Getting information.

I would highly suggest reading Bob Sehlinger and Len Testa’s The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World. It’s hefty book (848 pages hefty), but it’s well worth a skim. It’s chock full of good information, and is the best guide I’ve seen.

With The Unofficial Guide, you can also subscribe to their website TouringPlans.com. It’s $10/year, and for that you get touring plans and, more importantly, the Lines app for iOS or Android (there’s a web version, too). I’ll get to these later in the series.

DisBoards is an excellent online forum for asking any Disney-related questions you may have. The members there are quite knowledgeable and will give you great advice.

Walt Disney World also has a website. However, I cannot recommend using it for anything other than checking restaurant and hotel availability. It’s gotten a lot better over the years, but it gives very vague information and isn’t good for planning,


### When is the best time to go?

Generally, you want to go when it’s least crowded. The parks are more crowded when school is not in session (for obvious reasons). You may also want to keep in mind what special events are happening. For example, during April, the Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival is happening. During Christmastime, everywhere is decked out in festive garb. However, this is the busiest time of the year.

If you want to see a special event, you’re going to have to deal with the crowds. If you’re like me, and would like to see the World like it normally is, you go in the off-season.

Of course, this might be impossible for your family. Keep in mind that you can still have a great vacation with crowds. With the crowds, Disney keeps the parks open later, and all the rides are often open. If you go in the off-season, the parks open at 9am and close as early as 6pm. This means no evening entertainment like fireworks or parades. Also, Extra Magic Hours are often not offered.

In the winter (or, in Florida, the rainy season), the weather varies wildly. From November to March, daytime temperatures in the 40s or 50s (Fahrenheit) are not uncommon.

I think The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World by Len Testa puts it best.

> Given the choice, however, smaller crowds, bargain prices, and stress-free touring are worth risking cold weather or closed attractions. Touring in fall or other “off” periods is so much easier that our reasearch team, at the risk of being blasphemous, would advise taking children out of school for a Disney World visit.

In conclusion, I would say the very best time would be mid- to late-October. It’s still warm, and the Halloween decorations are (as I hear, I’ve never been during this time) amazing.

Keep in mind that, even during busy times, the parks are manageable. I’ve been during both February and April breaks, and with some tricks (that I’ll get to later), I was able to navigate the parks easily and avoid lines.


### What are Extra Magic Hours?

Extra Magic Hours is an offer for families staying at Disney-owned hotels. It is free, and allows hotel guests to, on select days of the week, enter a park an hour before or three hours after normal operating hours. This means that at peak times, when the parks are open from 7am–10pm, you can (theoretically) be in the park from 6am–1am. If you aren’t staying at a Disney hotel, you can still experience Extra Magic Hours. However, you will be barred from entering any rides. You can just shop and eat.

There are upsides and downsides to Extra Magic Hours. You can go on attractions with literally no wait, and go from ride to ride in minutes. For example, at Magic Kingdom, you could ride the Mountains (Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and Splash Mountain) before the park even opens.

However, the parks that have Extra Magic Hours are usually much more crowded than the ones that don’t. An option is getting to the park with Extra Magic Hours early (15 minutes before they let EMH attendees in), experience the major rides there, and then, using a Park Hopper (a kind of ticket that allows you to switch parks in the middle of the day), get over a park without EMH.

Plus, during nighttime Extra Magic Hours, a lot of rides close. The rides that are open usually are crowded.

I would suggest not going to a park with EMH, but that’s your choice.


### What about hotels?

The Disney-operated hotels (or, as they refer to them, “resorts”) vary wildly in price, location, amenities, and comfort. A later section will have a resort directory for your viewing pleasure.

In the meantime, I would suggest you decide what you can afford. There are three different tiers of Disney hotel pricing;
Value is the bottom tier. There are four hotels in this category, and have the smallest rooms, the least amenities, and lowest rates.
Moderate is the middle tier. There are five hotels in this category, and have medium sized rooms, good amenities, and middling rates.
Deluxe is the ultimate in Disney luxury. There are seven hotels in this category and have huge rooms, many amenities, are lusciously themed, and cost quite a bit of money.


### What about restaurant reservations?

Restaurant reservations are done differently at Disney, which I will get to in the Dining section.


### How to plan.

The planning process starts about four months before you plan on going. Here are some steps to take.

1. Decide when you want to go. Keep in mind crowd levels and special events.
2. Book your hotel room by visiting the Disney World website.
3. Make your restaurant reservations online.
4. Order your tickets.
5. Wait.

This concludes the Planning Ahead section of this humble guide. Next, Tickets!
